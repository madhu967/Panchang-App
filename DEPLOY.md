# 🚀 Deploying the Delete User Cloud Function

## Why This Is Needed

Firebase Auth user accounts **cannot be deleted from the mobile app** (client SDK).  
You need the **Firebase Admin SDK**, which only runs server-side via Cloud Functions.

The function `deleteAuthUser` handles:
1. ✅ Verifies the caller is an admin (Firestore `role: 'admin'` check)
2. ✅ Deletes the Firebase Auth user → **removes their email/password login**
3. ✅ Deletes the Firestore user document → **removes their profile data**

## One-Time Setup (Do Once)

### Step 1 — Install Firebase CLI
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2 — Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```
This opens a browser to log in with the Google account that owns your Firebase project.

### Step 3 — Set your Firebase Project
Inside the `panchangam-app` folder:
```bash
firebase use --add
```
Select your Firebase project from the list.

## Deploy the Function

### Step 4 — Install Function Dependencies
```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 5 — Deploy
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

You'll see output like:
```
✔  functions[deleteAuthUser]: Successful create operation.
Function URL: https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/deleteAuthUser
```

> **Note:** Cloud Functions require the **Blaze (pay-as-you-go)** Firebase plan.  
> The free Spark plan does not support outbound network calls from functions.  
> However, Firebase gives a generous free tier — you won't be charged for normal usage.

## After Deployment

Once deployed, the **Delete** button in the Admin → Manage Users screen will:
- Remove the user from Firebase Authentication (they can no longer log in)
- Delete their Firestore profile document
- The user must register again from scratch if they want access

---

## Updating the Function

After any changes to `functions/src/index.ts`, just run:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```
